# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

This project fullfils the criteria of building an effective portfolio to highlight my strongest work.

The site is responsive to mobile, tablet and desktop breakpoints; achieved through the use of Bootstrap.

The codebase follows best practice throughout (e.g. semantic HTML, class / ID naming conventions, indentation, quality comments and CSS variables).
